# GitHub Workflow Agents

Automated agents that maintain and resolve issues using Claude AI.

## Workflow Organization

Workflows are organized by **naming convention** (GitHub Actions doesn't support subdirectories):

### ✅ `core-*` - Core SeedGPT Workflows
**Planted into every new project**

These workflows provide the core SeedGPT functionality:
- `core-issue-generator-agent.yml` - AI-powered issue generation
- `core-issue-resolver-agent.yml` - Automated issue resolution
- `core-pr-failure-resolver-agent.yml` - Automated PR failure resolution
- `core-marketing-agent.yml` - Marketing automation
- `core-product-agent.yml` - Product management
- `core-qa-agent.yml` - Quality assurance
- `core-sales-agent.yml` - Sales automation
- `core-specialized-agents.yml` - Domain-specific agents
- `core-sanity-tests.yml` - Core sanity checks

### ❌ `apps-*` - Template Apps Workflows
**NOT planted (deleted during planting)**

CI/CD workflows for the SeedGPT template applications:
- `apps-seed-planter-api.yml` - Seed Planter API backend
- `apps-seed-planter-frontend.yml` - Seed Planter Frontend

These reference the `apps/` folder which is removed when planting new projects.

### ❌ `testing-*` - Development & Testing Workflows
**NOT planted (deleted during planting)**

Workflows for SeedGPT framework development:
- `testing-test-agents.yml` - Agent framework tests
- `testing-validate-agents.yml` - Configuration validation
- `testing-test-agents-with-env.yml.example` - Example config

These are only needed for developing the SeedGPT template itself.

## Core Workflows

### 1. Issue Generator Agent (`issue-generator-agent.yml`)

**Purpose**: Ensures the repository always has at least a minimum number of open issues.

**Schedule**: Every 10 minutes

**What it does**:
1. Counts current open issues
2. If below minimum (default: 3), generates new issues using Claude AI
3. Creates realistic, actionable issues based on repository analysis

**Configuration**:
```yaml
# Repository variables (Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → Variables)
MIN_OPEN_ISSUES: 3  # Minimum issues to maintain
```

**Manual trigger**:
```bash
# Via GitHub UI: Actions → Issue Generator Agent → Run workflow
# Or via gh CLI:
gh workflow run issue-generator-agent.yml -f min_issues=5
```

### 2. Issue Resolver Agent (`issue-resolver-agent.yml`)

**Purpose**: Automatically resolves open issues by analyzing them with Claude AI and creating PRs.

**Schedule**: Every 10 minutes (singleton - no overlapping executions)

**What it does**:
1. Finds an open issue to work on
2. Claims the issue (adds comment + `in-progress` label)
3. Analyzes the issue with Claude AI
4. Implements the fix
5. Creates a branch and commits changes
6. Pushes and creates a pull request
7. Updates the issue with PR link

**Configuration**:
```yaml
# Repository variables
ISSUE_LABELS_TO_HANDLE: bug,enhancement  # Only handle these labels
ISSUE_LABELS_TO_SKIP: wontfix,duplicate,in-progress  # Skip these labels
MAX_EXECUTION_TIME: 8  # Max minutes per run
```

**Manual trigger**:
```bash
# Resolve specific issue:
gh workflow run issue-resolver.yml -f issue_number=42

# Auto-select issue:
gh workflow run issue-resolver.yml
```

### 3. PR Failure Resolver Agent (`pr-failure-resolver-agent.yml`)

**Purpose**: Automatically fixes failing PR checks by analyzing failures with Claude AI and pushing fixes.

**Schedule**: Every 15 minutes (singleton - no overlapping executions)

**What it does**:
1. Finds an open PR with failing checks
2. Claims the PR (adds comment)
3. Analyzes the failure details with Claude AI
4. Implements fixes for the failures
5. Commits and pushes changes to the PR branch
6. Updates the PR with fix details
7. CI/CD re-runs automatically

**Configuration**:
```yaml
# Repository variables
MAX_EXECUTION_TIME: 8  # Max minutes per run
```

**Manual trigger**:
```bash
# Fix specific PR:
gh workflow run pr-failure-resolver-agent.yml -f pr_number=42

# Auto-select failing PR:
gh workflow run pr-failure-resolver-agent.yml
```

## Setup

### 1. Add Secrets

Go to **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → Secrets**:

```
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY: Your Claude API key from console.anthropic.com
```

Note: `GITHUB_TOKEN` is automatically provided by GitHub Actions.

### 2. Configure Variables (Optional)

Go to **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → Variables**:

```
MIN_OPEN_ISSUES: 3
ISSUE_LABELS_TO_HANDLE: bug,enhancement
ISSUE_LABELS_TO_SKIP: wontfix,duplicate,in-progress
MAX_EXECUTION_TIME: 8
```

### 3. Enable Workflows

The workflows will run automatically every 10 minutes once enabled.

## Customization

### Change Schedule

Edit the cron expression in the workflow files:

```yaml
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '*/10 * * * *'  # Every 10 minutes
    # - cron: '0 * * * *'   # Every hour
    # - cron: '0 0 * * *'   # Daily at midnight
```

### Customize Issue Selection

Edit `.github/scripts/issue_resolver.py`:

```python
# Add custom logic for issue selection
# Example: Prioritize by label
if 'critical' in issue_labels:
    selected_issue = issue
    break
```

### Customize Prompts

Edit the prompt in `.github/scripts/issue_generator.py` or `issue_resolver.py`:

```python
prompt = f"""Your custom prompt here...

Repository: {REPO_NAME}
...
"""
```

## Monitoring

### View Workflow Runs

Go to **Actions** tab to see all workflow runs.

### Check Logs

Click on any workflow run to see detailed logs.

### Workflow Status Badge

Add to your README:

```markdown
![Issue Generator](https://github.com/{owner}/{repo}/actions/workflows/issue-generator-agent.yml/badge.svg)
![Issue Resolver](https://github.com/{owner}/{repo}/actions/workflows/issue-resolver-agent.yml/badge.svg)
```

## Troubleshooting

### Workflow not running

- Check if workflows are enabled: **Actions → Enable workflows**
- Verify cron schedule is correct
- Check repository permissions

### Authentication errors

- Verify `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` secret is set correctly
- Check `GITHUB_TOKEN` has required permissions

### No issues being generated

- Check Claude API quota/limits
- Review workflow logs for errors
- Verify repository has README and content

### No issues being resolved

- Check if issues have required labels
- Verify issues aren't already claimed (`in-progress` label)
- Review workflow logs for errors

## Best Practices

1. **Monitor the agents**: Check workflow runs regularly
2. **Review PRs**: Always review agent-generated PRs before merging
3. **Adjust configuration**: Tune variables based on your needs
4. **Set rate limits**: Don't run too frequently to avoid API limits
5. **Use labels**: Properly label issues for better agent selection

## Security

- Secrets are encrypted and not exposed in logs
- Workflows run in isolated environments
- PRs require review before merging
- Agent actions are clearly marked and traceable

## Cost Considerations

- **GitHub Actions**: Free for public repos, limited minutes for private
- **Claude API**: Charged per token usage
- **Recommendation**: Monitor usage and adjust frequency as needed

## Examples

### Generate 5 issues manually

```bash
gh workflow run issue-generator-agent.yml -f min_issues=5
```

### Resolve specific issue

```bash
gh workflow run issue-resolver-agent.yml -f issue_number=123
```

### Disable temporarily

Comment out the schedule in the workflow file:

```yaml
on:
  # schedule:
  #   - cron: '*/10 * * * *'
  workflow_dispatch:  # Keep manual trigger
```
