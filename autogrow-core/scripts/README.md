# Automation Scripts

> **AI agents will generate helpful scripts here based on your project needs**

## What Gets Generated

- **`dev/`** - Development environment setup and helpers
- **`data/`** - Database migrations, seeding, backups
- **`testing/`** - Test runners and coverage tools
- **`ci/`** - Build, lint, and validation scripts
- **`maintenance/`** - Cleanup and health checks

## How It Works

1. AI reads your `PROJECT_BRIEF.md`
2. AI generates scripts for your tech stack
3. You get ready-to-use automation
