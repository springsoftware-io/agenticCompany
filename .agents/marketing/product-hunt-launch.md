## 👨‍💻 Maker Story

### The "Aha!" Moment

**Title**: "I Built a Project That Builds Itself"

**Story**:
```
Every developer has dozens of project ideas but time for maybe one or two.
I found myself thinking: "What if I had a development team working 24/7?"

That question led to SeedGPT.

**The problem:**
I'm a full-stack developer who loves building things. But between my day job,
family, and life, my side projects moved at a glacial pace. Great ideas stayed
in my head because execution was the bottleneck.

**The insight:**
Modern AI (especially Claude) is incredibly good at understanding context and
writing code. But we're using it wrong—as a tool we manually invoke. What if
AI agents worked autonomously, like a real dev team?

**What I built:**
SeedGPT is a framework where AI agents continuously evolve projects:
- A "Product Agent" that envisions features and creates tasks
- A "Dev Agent" that writes code and submits PRs
- A "QA Agent" that tests and validates changes
- A "Marketing Agent" that promotes and grows the product
- A "DevOps Agent" that manages infrastructure

You describe what you want to build, and these agents collaborate autonomously
to make it happen. They work while you sleep, while you're at your day job,
while you're with family.

**The "codes itself" moment:**
The coolest part? SeedGPT is building itself. This Product Hunt launch?
Created by the Marketing Agent (GitHub issue #87). Recent features? Coded by
the Dev Agent. Infrastructure? Managed by DevOps Agent.

It's genuinely a project that codes itself.

**Who it's for:**
- Entrepreneurs who want to build without being bottlenecked by coding
- Developers with too many ideas and too little time
- Teams that want to automate workflow creation
- Anyone who's ever thought "I wish I had a dev team working 24/7"

**What's next:**
Right now, you can use SeedGPT with your own GitHub and AI credentials (free,
you just pay API costs). We're building a managed platform where you can
start a project with one click and watch it grow.

The future of software isn't writing every line yourself. It's describing
what you want and having AI teams build it continuously.

**I'm here all day to answer questions!** What would you build if you had an
autonomous dev team?

## 💬 First 24 Hours Engagement Strategy

### Comment Response Framework

**Response Time Goal**: <15 minutes during active hours (6 AM - 11 PM PST)

**Response Template Structure:**
1. **Thank them** for their interest/question
2. **Answer specifically** to their question
3. **Add value** with extra insight or example
4. **Ask a follow-up** to encourage dialogue

**Example Responses:**

**Q: "How is this different from GitHub Copilot?"**
```
Great question! Copilot is an amazing tool for writing code line-by-line.
SeedGPT is different in a few key ways:

1. **Autonomous vs On-Demand**: Copilot assists when you're coding. SeedGPT's
   agents work 24/7 even when you're not at your computer.

2. **Full Features vs Code Snippets**: Copilot helps you write functions.
   SeedGPT agents plan entire features, implement them, test them, and submit
   PRs for review.

3. **Multi-Agent System**: We have specialized agents (Product, Dev, QA,
   DevOps, Marketing) that collaborate like a real team.

Think of Copilot as an AI pair programmer. SeedGPT is an AI development team
that works continuously. They're complementary—you could use both!

What kind of project would you want AI agents to build for you? 🤔
```

**Q: "Is this just another wrapper around GPT?"**
```
I appreciate the skepticism! There are definitely a lot of AI wrappers out there.

Here's what makes SeedGPT different:

1. **Autonomous Architecture**: We built a multi-agent system where agents
   collaborate via GitHub (issues, PRs, reviews). It's not just API calls—it's
   a genuine workflow.

2. **Context Management**: Agents maintain long-term project context, understand
   architecture decisions, and build on previous work (not just one-shot generations).

3. **Human-in-the-Loop**: Every PR requires your approval. You control frequency,
   budget, and direction. It's collaborative, not black-box.

4. **Self-Evolving**: The coolest part? SeedGPT is building itself. This Product
   Hunt launch was created by issue #87 from our Marketing Agent.

I'm open-sourcing everything so you can see exactly how it works. Check out the
code and judge for yourself!

What would convince you this is genuinely useful vs just hype?
```

**Q: "What about code quality and security?"**
```
SUPER important question! We take this seriously:

**Quality Controls:**
- Every PR requires human review before merging
- Automated testing in CI/CD pipeline
- Code review agent that checks style, patterns, security
- You can reject PRs and agents will iterate

**Security Approach:**
- Agents follow secure coding guidelines
- No secrets in code (env vars only)
- Dependency scanning in workflows
- You control what agents can access

**The Philosophy:**
Think of AI agents like junior developers—talented but need oversight. You're
the senior dev/architect who reviews everything. Nothing merges without your
explicit approval.

That said, I'd love your input on improving quality controls! What specific
concerns do you have?
```

**Q: "How much does this cost?"**
```
Great question! We have two models:

**1. Self-Hosted (Free):**
- Use your own GitHub and AI API credentials
- You only pay for API usage (usually $5-50/month depending on agent frequency)
- Full control and transparency
- Open source, no lock-in

**2. Managed Platform (Coming Soon):**
- We handle all infrastructure and credentials
- Pricing: Your actual costs + 15% for platform operations
- One-click project creation
- Built-in monitoring and management

Most developers start self-hosted to experiment, then upgrade to managed when
they want to scale multiple projects.

The beauty is transparency—you always know exactly what you're paying for. No
hidden fees or surprises!

Would self-hosted work for you, or do you prefer managed?
```

**Q: "Can I try this right now?"**
```
Absolutely! Here's the quickest path:

**5-Minute Quick Start:**
1. Clone: `git clone https://github.com/roeiba/SeedGPT`
2. Add your GitHub token and Claude API key to secrets
3. Enable GitHub Actions
4. Watch your first AI-generated issue appear!

**Full Setup Guide:**
https://github.com/roeiba/SeedGPT#-getting-started

**Live Examples:**
https://roeiba.github.io/SeedGPT/ - See real projects built with SeedGPT

If you hit any issues, drop a GitHub issue and I'll help you personally!

I'd love to hear what you end up building 🚀
```

### Engagement Types to Encourage

**1. Success Stories**
- Ask users to share what they're building

**4. Comparisons**
- Address competitor questions honestly
- Highlight unique differentiation
- Acknowledge where others excel

**5. Skepticism**
- Thank skeptics for keeping you honest

### Things to Avoid

❌ **Over-promising**: Be realistic about capabilities
❌ **Defensive**: Welcome criticism constructively
❌ **Salesy**: Focus on helping, not pitching
❌ **Generic**: Personalize every response
❌ **Slow**: Respond quickly, especially first few hours
❌ **Arguing**: Agree to disagree gracefully if needed

### Launch Day Thread (Post at 6 AM PST)

```
🧵 Today I'm launching SeedGPT on @ProductHunt – a project that literally codes itself.

Here's the story of building something that builds itself 🌱👇

[Link to Product Hunt]

1/10
```

```
Every developer has 10+ project ideas but time for maybe 1.

I had the same problem. Dozens of side projects, all moving at glacial pace.

Then I thought: "What if I had a dev team working 24/7?"

That question changed everything.

2/10
```

```
The insight: Modern AI (especially Claude) is incredible at coding.

But we're using it wrong—as a tool we manually invoke.

What if AI agents worked autonomously, like a real development team?

That's what I built.

3/10
```

```
SeedGPT is a multi-agent system where AI agents collaborate to build your project:

📋 Product Agent - Creates tasks
💻 Dev Agent - Writes code
🧪 QA Agent - Tests everything
📊 Marketing Agent - Grows the product
⚙️ DevOps Agent - Manages infrastructure

They work while you sleep.

4/10
```

```
Here's the coolest part:

SeedGPT is building itself.

This Product Hunt launch? Created by the Marketing Agent (issue #87).
Recent features? Dev Agent.
Infrastructure? DevOps Agent.

It's genuinely a project that codes itself.

5/10
```

```
"But isn't this dangerous? What about quality?"

Great question. You're the senior developer:

✅ Approve every PR
✅ Set agent frequencies
✅ Control budgets
✅ Curate the backlog

Agents are like talented juniors. You maintain control.

6/10
```

```
Use cases people are building:

🚀 SaaS products
⚙️ Data pipelines
🤖 Automation workflows
📊 Analytics dashboards
🛠️ Developer tools
💼 Full businesses

Basically anything that can be coded can be built autonomously.

7/10
```

```
Two ways to use it:

1. **Self-hosted**: Free, use your own credentials
2. **Managed**: Coming soon, we handle everything at cost + 15%

Open source, transparent, no lock-in.

See live examples: https://roeiba.github.io/SeedGPT/

8/10
```

```
The future of software isn't writing every line yourself.

It's describing what you want and having AI teams build it continuously.

Not "AI-assisted coding."

Fully autonomous development.

9/10

### Launch Post (Post at 6 AM PST)

```
🚀 Today I'm launching SeedGPT—a project that codes itself

After 6 months of development, I'm excited to share something I've been working
on that I think will change how we build software.

**The Problem:**
As a full-stack developer, I had dozens of project ideas but time for maybe one
or two. Great ideas stayed in my head because execution was the bottleneck.

**The Solution:**
What if you had a development team working 24/7? That's SeedGPT.

**How it works:**
AI agents collaborate autonomously to build your project:
• Product Agent creates features and tasks
• Dev Agent writes code and submits PRs
• QA Agent tests and validates changes
• DevOps Agent manages infrastructure
• Marketing Agent grows your product

You describe what you want to build. Agents do the rest. Continuously.

**The "codes itself" moment:**
SeedGPT is building itself. This Product Hunt launch? Created by the Marketing
Agent (GitHub issue #87). Recent features? Coded by the Dev Agent.

It's genuinely a project that codes itself.

**What you can build:**
✅ SaaS applications
✅ Data pipelines and ETL
✅ Automation workflows
✅ Developer tools
✅ Full businesses

**Try it:**
• Free with your own credentials
• Open source and transparent
• See live examples: https://roeiba.github.io/SeedGPT/
• We're #1 on Product Hunt today: [Link]

The future of software development isn't writing every line yourself. It's
describing what you want and having AI teams build it continuously.

I'm answering questions all day—what would you build with an autonomous dev team?
