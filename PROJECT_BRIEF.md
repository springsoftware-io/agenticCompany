## 🎯 Project Overview

**Project Name**: Exit Papers

**Goal**: Help users set up a complete, professional-grade project and company infrastructure—easily and correctly.

**Brief Description**:
As of Nov 16, 2025, many AI agents exist, but most people don’t know how to use them. Businesses often charge users for simple wrappers while providing little real value. Exit Papers guides users through all the steps of setting up a real, operational project—code, cloud, agents, payments, marketing, and more—using a simple interface.

Every step can be done manually through clear instructions or automatically via a “Do you trust me?” button that authorizes Exit Papers to perform the action on the user’s behalf.

**Problem Statement**:
Building software and launching a product is difficult for ordinary users. With proper guidance and automation, even beginners—including kids—can successfully build and deploy real businesses. Exit Papers removes complexity, prevents users from being exploited by low-value wrappers, and delivers transparent, trustworthy automation.

**Target Users**:
Anyone who wants to accomplish something online—software projects, businesses, automations—without the complexity. Suitable for beginners, solo founders, small businesses, and users who want “just make it work.”

**Proposed Solution**:
A gamified, stateless web app that walks the user through all required steps to create a functioning company and infrastructure:

* **GitHub Setup**:

  * Log in or create an account
  * Create the first project
  * Optionally authorize Exit Papers to create repos, configure CI/CD, and set everything up automatically

* **Cloud Provider Selection**:

  * AWS
  * GCP
  * Azure
  * Each with manual instructions or automated provisioning via authorization

* **Payments Setup**:

  * Create or connect a Stripe account (or alternative payment provider)
  * Link payment systems to relevant services and agents

* **Agent Integrations**:

  * Claude.ai
  * ChatGPT/Codex
  * Gemini
  * Lovable
  * Base44
  * Replit
  * Show that multiple agents can work simultaneously
  * Help users connect GitHub accounts inside each agent
  * Assist in linking Stripe to agents for billing and usage

* **Marketing**

  * Help the user connect their social accounts
  * Provide a HubSpot agent flow for CRM and marketing automations

* **Sales**

  * Guide users through connecting payment systems to products and funnels
  * Assist with checkout links, subscription plans, and sales tracking

* **Funding & Budgets**

  * Allow the user to set and manage cards and payment methods
  * Provide basic budgeting so agents and cloud resources cannot overspend

**Business Model**:
Open-source foundation with sponsorships and ecosystem funding.

**Technical Details**:
Exit Papers integrates with core services spanning e-commerce, advertising, marketing, operations, and social media.
It uses:

* Cloudflare for DNS and CDN
* GitHub for source control, CI/CD, and automation
* Major cloud providers for infrastructure

The system applies semantic caching, intelligent library usage, and consistent boilerplate to keep projects fast and maintainable. The root remains clean, with each app containing its own `.agents` directory for agent configuration. Subfolders house READMEs describing the purpose and behavior of each agent.
