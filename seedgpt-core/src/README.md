# Source Code

> **AI agents will generate your application code here based on `PROJECT_BRIEF.md`**

## What Gets Generated

Depending on your requirements, AI will create:

- **`backend/`** - API server
- **`frontend/`** - Web UI
- **`mobile/`** - Mobile apps
- **`admin/`** - Admin dashboard
- **`shared/`** - Shared libraries
- **`blackboxtesting/`** - Integration tests

AI creates only what you need - not all folders.

## How It Works

1. Fill out `PROJECT_BRIEF.md`
2. AI reads your requirements
3. AI generates appropriate apps with:
   - Complete source code
   - Tests
   - Configuration files
   - Documentation
