# project-docs/ - All Documentation

## Folders
- `docs/` - Technical & user docs (API, guides, setup, troubleshooting)
- `knowledge_base/` - Business knowledge (requirements, domain, research, decisions)
- `architecture/` - System design (diagrams, ADRs, patterns, tech choices)

## Rules
- Living docs: update with code changes, link to code/tasks
- Markdown, kebab-case naming, date docs, note status
- Review quarterly, archive outdated
- Add TOC if >500 lines, diagrams where helpful

## Document Type
- Business context/requirements → `knowledge_base/`
- System design/tech decisions → `architecture/`
- Everything else → `docs/`
