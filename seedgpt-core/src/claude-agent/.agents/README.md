# Claude Agent - Agent Metadata

This directory contains agent-specific metadata and documentation.

## Purpose

The `.agents` folder follows the project convention of maintaining agent data in a hierarchical structure.

## Contents

- Development utilities
- Agent-specific notes
- Temporary build artifacts

## Convention

As per project rules, `.agents` folders are maintained at every level of the hierarchy to organize agent-related data separately from application code.
